# Calibration of the Conductivity Sensor (K=1)

- Probe Rincing : rince the probe and dry it 
- Probe Cleaning : lightly brushing around the conducting area 
- Check Probe type : K,? if necessary set Probe type : K,1

3 points calibration method : 
- Dry Calibration point : 
When the probe is dry, perform a dry calibration using : Cal,dry
- Low point calibration : 
Place the probe onto a recipe containing low calibration solution
++ Tips : shake the probe to remove the air bubbles
Then wait for the reading to staibilize and ONLY when it is perform low calibration point : cal,low,84
- High point calibration : 
Place the probe onto a recipe containing high calibration solution
++ Tips : shake the probe to remove the air bubbles
Then wait for the reading to staibilize and ONLY when it is perform high calibration point : cal,high,1413
